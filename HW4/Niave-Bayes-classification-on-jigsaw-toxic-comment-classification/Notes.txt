#points for the rem
Incread the vector size increases the accuracy a little. 
1. The model accuracy  
        vector size =5000 and val =0.3 
        val accuracy = 0.947
        test_accuracy = 0.3824 compared to test_label provied for toxic comment

2. Tried to change the feature size but didn't had much effect on accuracy
3. Tried to change the dataset validation set and it turnout that as increwasing the training set increases the accruacy by 2 percentage. 

# Add this parts to main code
4. Added Unkown to some place where data is missing top improve the accruacy
5. Because the test_labels contain -1 value for accruacy we don't need to consider it so just remove that while considering the accuracy.
6. Drop all the rows from testing set as well test_label_set so that we can get the accruacy of the model. 
        This gave the accuracy of 0.9169
7. For the comparing and contrasting two model, used the precision recall, f1 score and roc_auc curve to compare.
