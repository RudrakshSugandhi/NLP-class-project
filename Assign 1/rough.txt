Things to add in report:
1.Write out the logic behind your regex decisions and discoveries to a report. For 
example, were there words that your regex did not capture that it was? Or does it 
capture incorrect words? This could also be how you built up the regexes, (“I started 
with this simple expressions, but it didn’t capture x so I augmented it ...")
